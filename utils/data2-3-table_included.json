While single follow-up of tiny \"white dot\" lesions at 2 years is appropriate, the need for further follow-up and length of follow-up, if stable, is unknown. Some radiologists do not report these lesions for patients with advanced age (>75-80 years of age).\n2. Imaging follow-up with contrast-enhanced MRI or pancreas protocol CT.\n3. Growth defined as 100% increase in longest axis diameter (on axial or coronal image) for cysts <5mm, and 50% increase for cysts \u22655mm and <15mm. No growth = stable.\n4. Following growth, imaging follow-up or EUS/FNA may be performed. In general, EUS/FNA merits stronger consideration for larger or faster-growing cysts relative to smaller or slower-growing cysts. After EUS/FNA, further work-up is result-dependent (see Figure 2B).\n5. Some may choose to continuously follow cysts detected in patients <65-years-old until those patients reach 80.\n6. If the patient reaches 80 years before the end of follow-up, follow-up should generally stop. If the patient is close to - but not yet - 80 years when the cyst is first detected, then when the patient reaches 80 years, Figure 4 can be used to guide further management.\n7. *Appearance of any mural nodule, wall thickening, dilation of MPD \u22657mm, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction/jaundice should prompt immediate EUS/FNA and surgical evaluation regardless of size or amount of growth.\n8. **Appearance of any mural nodule, wall thickening, dilation of MPD \u22657mm, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction/jaundice should prompt immediate EUS/FNA and surgical evaluation regardless of size or amount of growth.\n\nFig 1.
